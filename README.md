H&D Solution  / Owner
01-2003 / 07-2021

I led the development of solutions for various industries, managing the entire software life cycle. The industries I had as clients were diverse, both in specialization and size. I had clients such as restaurants, pharmacies, shoe factories, clothing factories, CD and DVD factories, beauty product distributors, a company dedicated to the repair of specific electronic equipment for video cable and satellite video receivers, among others.
My role in this own venture was very broad and diverse, going through the role of business analyst, carrying out the survey of problems with clients and employees of the companies, as well as carrying out high and low level designs, definitions of database diagrams and writing the requirements of each module to be developed in each case. In my beginnings I also acted as a developer, tester, implementer and carried out the task of providing reactive and preventive maintenance to each development. Then I was able to expand my staff and my company managed to grow until it had 5 developers, of which I was part as a technical leader.
In the beginning I used technologies such as Microsoft Visual Foxpro with SQL Server to develop and then I migrated my developments to C# and .NET Framework, starting to use the net framework version 3.5 until version 4.8. I also started using net core with MVC and Razor technologies to develop web applications.
  Used Python and OpenSSL to develop a connectivity library to use electronic billing in Argentina, integrating it with my ERP software. I also successfully implemented the integration of my ERP software with electronic invoicing in Uruguay, using C#, JWT authentication and Sha256 cryptography.
My greatest achievement in all this time was managing to insert new technologies into small and medium-sized companies, improving both their productivity and as a result increasing their profitability, as well as their data security.
